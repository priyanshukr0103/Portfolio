# Certification Images

This directory contains images for certification badges displayed in the portfolio.

2. Name them appropriately (e.g., oracle-java.jpg, oracle-cloud.jpg, azure-cert.jpg)
3. Update the image paths in the app/page.tsx file if necessary

The recommended image size is 800x600 pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3.
